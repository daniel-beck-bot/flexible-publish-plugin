<div>
Defines how flexible-publish handles errors of publishers in this condition.
Built-in strategies:
<dl>
  <dt>Fail at end</dt>
    <dd>
      Performs all publishers even some of them fail.
      This is the behavior same to Jenkins core.
    </dd>
  <dt>Fail fast</dt>
    <dd>
      Stop performing following publishers if a publisher fails.
      This was the behavior in Flexible publish 0.14.1 and prior.
    </dd>
</dl>
